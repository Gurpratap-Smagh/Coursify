# Backend Header Fixes

To improve security and performance, you should add the following headers to your backend's responses. You can do this easily by using the `helmet` package.

### 1. Install Helmet

In your backend directory, run:

```bash
npm install helmet
```

### 2. Use Helmet in Your Express App

In your main backend file (e.g., `index.js` or `app.js`), add the following:

```javascript
import helmet from 'helmet';

// ... after you initialize your app
const app = express();

// Use helmet to set various security headers
app.use(helmet());

// This will automatically handle:
// - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
// - X-Powered-By: (removes this header)
// - And many other security best practices.

// To set a Cache-Control header for static assets, you can do this
// if you are serving them with Express. If you are using a CDN or
// a service like Vercel/Netlify for your frontend, they often handle this.
app.use(express.static('public', {
  maxAge: '1d' // Cache for 1 day
}));
```

By adding `helmet`, you will resolve the `x-content-type-options` and `x-powered-by` warnings. The `cache-control` warning is for static assets and may already be handled by your hosting provider for the frontend, but the configuration above shows how you would do it in Express.
